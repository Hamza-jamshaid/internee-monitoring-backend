# Cloud Monitoring & Log Analysis – Internee.pk

## Introduction
This project implements cloud monitoring and log analysis for the Internee.pk backend system using Microsoft Azure. The goal is to ensure system performance, reliability, and proactive issue detection.

## Objective
- Monitor backend performance metrics such as CPU usage and response time
- Analyze logs to detect failed requests and errors
- Configure alerts for system failures
- Improve application observability and reliability

## Technology Stack
- Node.js (Backend)
- Azure App Service (Web App)
- Azure Monitor
- Application Insights
- Log Analytics
- GitHub Actions (Deployment)

## Monitoring Implementation
- Application Insights enabled for backend telemetry
- Metrics monitored: CPU usage, request count, response time, failed requests
- Logs analyzed using KQL queries

## Alerts
- High CPU usage alert
- Failed request alert
- Application availability alert

## Results
- Real-time monitoring dashboards created
- Logs successfully analyzed using KQL
- Alerts triggered on simulated failures
- Improved visibility into system health

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how Azure Monitor and Log Analytics can be used to monitor cloud applications effectively. This implementation enables proactive issue detection, better performance analysis, and prepares the system for scalable production deployment.
